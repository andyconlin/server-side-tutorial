This is understandably old. The article is dated Jan 22, 2016 and I went through it on Oct 28, 2019. The tutorial is basic enough, however, that the point of it (for me) was to grasp the basic concepts of Express and Node and get a slight introduction to MongoDB. In this regard, I believe it was successful.

This has given me enough knowledge to know ___how___ to look for answers, and ___what___ to learn next.
